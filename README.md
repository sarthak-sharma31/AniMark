# 🎬 AniMark (Legacy Version)

---

## 🔷 Introduction

AniMark is an anime tracking and management web application that allows users to browse anime, mark them as watched, and manage their personal anime lists.

This repository contains the **earlier version** of AniMark. It represents the foundational architecture and core feature implementation before later improvements and optimizations.

The goal of this project was to build a functional full-stack application with authentication, data persistence, and dynamic UI rendering.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- RESTful Routing
- Authentication Middleware

---

## ⭐ Features (What Users Can Do)

- Register and log in securely
- Browse anime content
- Mark anime as watched
- Add anime to personal lists
- View saved/marked anime
- Persist user-specific data
- Session-based authentication

## ⚙️ The Process (How I Built It)

1. Designed the backend using Express.js and structured routes using REST principles.
2. Created MongoDB schemas using Mongoose to manage users and anime data.
3. Implemented authentication middleware for protected routes.
4. Used EJS to dynamically render pages based on user data.
5. Built user-specific functionality like marking and storing anime.
6. Structured the project in MVC-style organization for maintainability.

This version focused primarily on building backend logic correctly rather than UI polish.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to structure a full-stack application
- Building authentication systems
- Managing user sessions securely
- Designing MongoDB schemas properly
- Implementing protected routes with middleware
- Server-side rendering with EJS
- Handling dynamic user-specific data

This project significantly strengthened my backend understanding.

- Add role-based permissions
- Add rate limiting and improved security practices
- Migrate to modern frontend frameworks
- Optimize database queries for performance
